## Core Requirements


* **Title or Menu Screen**: The game should start with a title screen featuring a game logo and a message to start the game. Alternatively, it could be a menu screen with options to start the game, view the instructions, or quit the game.

* **Game Screen**: From the title or menu screen, the player should be able to start the game. The game screen displays the paddle, the ball, and the level. The player moves the paddle using the keyboard. The goal is to move from one level to the next by destroying all the blocks in every level. In our game, the objective of the player is to reach the end by passing through all the levels.

* **Victory Screen**: Upon passing through all the levels, a victory screen displays a congratulatory message, allowing the player to return to the title screen. Some animation, possibly from lab class exercises, should play in the background to indicate the game's completion. You are at liberty to come up with the animation.
